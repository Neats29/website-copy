                <p clas="top-description">Here is my list of recommended services with a focus on privacy. Since the leak of the NSA documents by the wistleblower Edward Snowden I have reflected on my internet activities and have sought services that value privacy and encyptions. However not everything on this list is about privacy, some of these are just my favourite tools (in no specific order).</p>

If you don't want your emails to be read, request an invite to get an account on ProtonMail. This is a service that started as a direct result of Snowden's leaks, a couple of smart kids from MIT and CERN came up with a form of encyption that means even the company itself has no access to your data, the servers are also based at Switzerland, a neutral state independent of the EU and US. They have since seen a great demand and are in the process of purchasing more servers so I am still on the waiting list!</p>

Soon after I discovered Treehouse, and I have been hooked since! It is an amazing and affordable online learning resource. It is one of the most enjoyable learning experiences I have had.</p>

I have tried Sublime Text, Atom and Brackets so could only compare these but Brackets is definitly my favourite. It is free and open source, installing plugins and themes is super easy and overall it is a seamless experience. GitHub's Atom is also free and open source and comes very close.</p>

You will regain faith in humanity and fall involve with the planet. Some of the most talented and adventurous photographers share their work on here. This is predominently an iPhone app but they also have a website.</p>

It is hands down the best music production software by far (Ok I might be a bit biased) but it is an industry standard, the only downside is that it is exclusive to Apple and well the price tag could improve a bit.</p>
